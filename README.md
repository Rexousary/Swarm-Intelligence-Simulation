# 🐝 Swarm Intelligence Battle Simulation

> **Build. Deploy. Dominate.** — A competitive AI/ML challenge where swarm strategy is everything.

---

## 🧠 What Is It?

**Swarm Intelligence Battle Simulation** is an interactive, team-based competition designed for AI/ML enthusiasts. Participants design and program **mini agent swarms**, define their behavioral rules, and pit them against rival swarms across dynamic, hostile environments.

The best strategist wins — not the loudest algorithm.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Build Your Swarm
Each team creates a swarm of mini agents. Every agent follows a set of **programmable behavior rules** you define:

| Behavior Mode | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| ⚔️ **Attack**  | Agents seek and eliminate enemy swarms |
| 🛡️ **Defend**  | Agents protect territory or key resources |
| 🔍 **Search**  | Agents scout, map, and gather intel |

> Mix and match modes — the smartest combos win.

### 2. Enter the Battleground
Swarms clash across three unique environments, each with different terrain dynamics and survival conditions:

| 🌲 Forest | 👽 Alien Planet | 💻 Cyber Grid |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Dense cover, flanking opportunities | Unknown terrain, unpredictable hazards | Structured paths, fast-paced node battles |

### 3. Let the Battle Begin
Deploy your swarm. Watch the simulation run. Adapt or perish.

**Winner** = The team whose swarm demonstrates the most effective, adaptive, and efficient strategy.
